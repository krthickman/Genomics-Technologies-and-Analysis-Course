# Genomics-Technologies-and-Analysis-Course
Information and materials for a bioengineering focused course on genomics technologies and analysis

In this set of files you will find the basic materials that I developed to teach a course on genomics focused on Bioengineering. 
This course includes information on the basics of genetics and genomic data. It explores the technologies used for sequencing DNA, and 
for performing basic analysis of these genomes. Please feel free to use. If you have questions, I am happy to try to answer them.
